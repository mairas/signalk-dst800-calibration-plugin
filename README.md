# Signal K Node Server Airmar DST800 Calibration Plugin

This plugin implements calibration functionality for Airmar DST800 family
triducers.

Functionality is shoehorned into the plugin configuration. Check a box for
value to retrieve, submit. Reload the page to see the new value. Then update
values, select new boxes, submit, reload, etc. Terrible, I know.

The `analyze_stw.ipynb` notebook contains some code to create a calibration
curve for the speed through water sensor. There are some comments in the code;
ask if/when you have questions. I am mairas on the Signal K Slack.
